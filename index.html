       <b> StarryNight </b> been called <b>Van Gogh's quintessential work</b>. 
       It has been in MoMa's permanent collection since 1941 and was acquired through <b>Lillie P. Bliss Bequest</b>.
        'Starry Night' is an oil on the canvas and was painted by Van Gogh in a studio on the first floor of the Saint-Paul-de Mausole asylum.
